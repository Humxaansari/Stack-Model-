# Stack-Model-
In this project, we will be using several datasets containing data for Heart Failure
Diseases from Open Sources Such as Kaggle and Google, and apply multiple
machine learning models to predict the possible occurrence of heart failure.
In this dataset we will predict the death event from behave of features and
attributes using Machine Learning models and calculate the measurements from
models, Also data analysis visualization.
